Possible enhancements:
1. Write more tests to test threadsafe behaviour for multiple transfers between accounts
 at the same time e.g. A to B, A to C, B to C, C to A.
2. Validations can be moved in one validator which can be injected in controller and can return
response before even it gets to Service layer.
